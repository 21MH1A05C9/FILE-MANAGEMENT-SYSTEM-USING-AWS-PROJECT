Project Overview:
-----------------
The File management System project is a comprehensive web application that leverages the power of Express.js and Amazon S3 to offer a robust solution for user management and file storage. The primary objective of this application is to facilitate seamless user registration, authentication, and efficient file management operations, including upload, listing, downloading, and deletion of files.

This project is also a web application designed to manage user registration, authentication, and file operations using Express.js and Amazon S3. Users can register, log in, upload files, list their files, download specific files, and delete files. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, MongoDB for user data storage, and AWS S3 for scalable file storage. Security is ensured through bcrypt for password hashing and environment variables for configuration. The application employs multer for efficient file handling and AWS SDK for seamless S3 integration, providing a robust solution for secure and efficient file management.
